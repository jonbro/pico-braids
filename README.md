This repo is a quick and dirty port of mutable instruments braids to the rpi pico. You'll need the [demo board](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pimoroni-pico-vga-demo-base) or equivelent i2s board.

You'll also need the to get the [pico playground](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-playground) audio examples up and running.

Its possible to send the audio out to pwm, I've just stripped that code out.
